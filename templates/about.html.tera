<h2>~~~About~~~</h2>
<div class="inner">
    <p>
        I am currently a freelance Python/Django/Flask fullstack web developer living and working in the Northeast section of Minneapolis. In my previous life, I spent 12 years delivering
        top-tier audio projects for big name brands and politicians with the fastest turnaround in the industry, in doing so I helped develop and create proprietary software tools for the
        company to go from audition to final product faster than the competition. Outside of work, I enjoy the wonderful world of being a Maker. I love going to Art and History museums,
        eating at amazing restaurants and drinking the amazing craft beers around Minneapolis and going to Twins games during baseball season.
